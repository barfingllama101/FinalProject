            <h2>About the Developer</h2>
            <p>
               Hi! My name is Kimmy. I like Stardew Valley. I do a lot of things and I really, really love
            <a href="https://squishmallows.com">Squishmallows.</a> . I am a Gamification Programmer for a <a href=" www.fruitfulhealth.org"> startup out of LA</a> and a brand new <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/bciresearchrit/home">Researcher for NXT</a>(I deal with the ugly physics engine stuff). I am an incomming Associate Developer at GeekHive and I am also a contract employee for the Unity game engine working on the Learn Team. I've been working in serious games since 2015 and you can see some stuff I've worked on at some different Universities and a few companies worldwide. That's enough of all that listing. It's a lot of boring stuff that has nothing to do with cows. You can usually find me in the SSE, WIC space, CODERIT meetings, IGM labs, or at Target buying more Squishmallows. Come see me during my labbie hours in the big IGM lab!
